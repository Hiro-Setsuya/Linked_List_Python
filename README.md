# Linked_List_Python
The program uses a Node class to represent each item and a LinkedList class to manage the collection. This project demonstrates basic linked list operations, including appending, searching, and deletion.

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Linked List data structure, designed to store and manage tasks and notes. The linked list allows users to:

Append new tasks or notes to the list.
Display all tasks and notes with their titles and content.
Search for tasks or notes by keyword in their title or content.
Delete tasks or notes by index or title.
